# Future Frontend: SQLite Demo

This is the source repository for the SQLite demo app presented at [Future Frontend January 2024 meetup](https://meetabit.com/events/future-frontend-january-2024/).

## Frontend

The app in [frontend](./frontend) directory is the frontend for a Todo app, forked from https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react

To get started, install dependencies:

```console
bun i
```

Start the server:

```console
bun run serve
```

Open the application in [your browser](http://127.0.0.1:7002).
